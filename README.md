# Rationals


This repository contains code that implements an interface and two implementations of that interface for representing a fraction as a numerator and denominator. The implemented methods allow for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more, without altering the original Rationals being operated on. The code follows a philosophy of immutability to ensure reliability and accuracy of calculations.
